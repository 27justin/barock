**minidrm** is a C++ header-only library designed to simplify the
Linux DRM API and streamlining the process to get a hardware
accelerated environment without X11/Wayland.

* Features
+ RAII-based wrappers for connectors, modes, CRTC's, cards, etc.
+ Simple way to get started with EGL

* Getting Started
1. Copy the ~minidrm.hpp~ file into your project.
2. Create a dedicated implementation file, where you include it
   alongside a ~#define MINIDRM_IMPLEMENTATION~
3. Link against ~libdrm~

To enable the hardware accelerated framebuffers, you have to:
1. ~#define MINIDRM_EGL~ before including ~minidrm.hpp~, or pass
   ~-DMINIDRM_EGL~ to your compiler flags.
2. Additionally link your application against ~libgbm~, ~libGLESv2~,
   and ~libEGL~
